# probabilistic tools
Here are some useful pytorch tools for probabilistic modeling.

### Low rank gaussian with covariance form $LL^T+\sigma^2I$
1. entropy
2. sample with reparameterization trick

### Closed form KL divergence between two gaussians
1. between two diagnal gaussians
2. between two low rank gaussians
3. general KL between two gaussians

### Categorical distribution
1. sample a batch using gumbel max trick
